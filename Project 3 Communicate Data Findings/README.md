## Summary of Findings

In my exploration I found out that generally people apply for loans in the first month of the year, meaning that many people plan for their activities within the new calendar year, most people who apply for the loans are in some kind of employment and they are the ones who apply for most loan amounts.

Also I found out that more investors fund loans in mid year period and in every calendar year, and also it is very likely that on each calendar year there is a very high possibility that there will be a self-employed loan applicant.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In the presentation, I will focus on explaining which employment status has most loan applicants and which month has the highest number of loan applicants.

Afterwards I will look at the relationship between loan amount and categorical and quantitative data Employment status and income range respectively, I will look at also whether the months affect the loan applications of the highest category of loan applicants who are the employed people.

Lastly I will I explore the distribution of the loan amounts in various states across loan applicants of different employment statuses
