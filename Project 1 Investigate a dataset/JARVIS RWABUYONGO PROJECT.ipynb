    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "For my first project I will be analyzing and drawing some conclusions based on a dataset showing no-show and show data for medical appointments from Brazil, combined with some other data from which the original source is [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of the values in the dataset\n",
    "- Age =>Tells us how old the patients are.\n",
    "- Alcoholism => Is the patient an alcoholic?.\n",
    "- AppointmentDay => The day the patient has to meet the doctor.\n",
    "- AppointmentID => Identification of the appointment.\n",
    "- Diabetes => Is the patient diabetic or not.\n",
    "- Gender => Gender of the patient.\n",
    "- Handcap => Shows us if the patient is handicapped.\n",
    "- Hipertension => Shows us if the patient suffers from hypertension.\n",
    "- Neighborhood => Where the hospital is located.\n",
    "- No-show => Shows us wether the patient showed up or did not show up for the appointment.\n",
    "- PatientId => Identification of the patient.\n",
    "- ScheduledDay => this tells us on what day the patient had set up their appointment.\n",
    "- Scholarship => Shows us if the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.\n",
    "- SMS_received => 1 or more messages received by the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions asked:\n",
    "**Based on the data present, I was able to come up with the questions below as to why the patients may not show up for their scheduled medical appointments in Brazil**\n",
    "- Can the age of the patients be a factor for them to show up or not show up for the medical appointments?\n",
    "- Does the patient's health condition affect if they will show up for their medical appointments?\n",
    "- Does sending an SMS regarding the medical appointment to the patients help them show up for their appointments?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading of libraries and packages to be used in the project:"

    "\n",
    "* **Can the age of the patients be a factor for them to show up or not show up for the medical appointments?**\n",
    "  * Generally, there is no clear pattern of age that determines whether the patients will attend their appointment or not\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Does the patient's health condition affect if they will show up for their medical appointments?**\n",
    "  * I dived into four health conditions which were Alcoholism, Hypertension, Handicap and Diabetes and clearly found out that these health conditions do matter in the question of whether the patient will attend the appointment or not. With an exception to alcoholism, people who suffered Hypertension, Handicap and Diabetes were more likely to make the appointment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Does sending an SMS regarding the medical appointment to the patients help them show up for their appointments?**\n",
    "  * Generally, sending an sms does not help them show up for the appointments as the people who did not receive an sms attended their appointments better \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the limitations I came upon to discover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In the data source we are told that SMS_received means 1 or more messages sent to the patient, there is no any specification whether the sms was sent prior to the appointment day and by what time, basically I think sending an sms before the appointment day would actually help boost the attendance of patients to their appointments**\n",
